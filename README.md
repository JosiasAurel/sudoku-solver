# Sodoku Solver

A brute-force sudoku solver using what I think is backtracking... 
It's backtracking I promise.

Sudoku is a 9-by-9 game where you get a grid with partially filled numbers and your goal is to fill them such that there are no duplicate numbers on the same column, row and 3-by-3 sub-grid.

Ugh Wikipedia better explains [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) I think.

## How to solve sudoku

1. Look over the grid step-by-step
2. If you encounter an empty slot, 
    - Look at the numbers in use on the slots column, row and 3-by-3 sub-grid.
    - Determine what numbers between 0-9 are in neither the column, row or 3-by-3 sub-grid.
3. continue
4. If you find yourself in a dead end, move backwards and try a different number
    * If you've exhausted all numbers on the current slot, still move back
